# VBA Stock Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a VBA script designed for analyzing stock market data. The script loops through stock data, calculates yearly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volumes, and applies conditional formatting. Additionally, it identifies stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Features
- **Yearly Stock Analysis**: Calculates the yearly change, percentage change, and total volume for each stock.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
- **Multi-Year Analysis**: Capable of running the analysis across multiple worksheets, each representing a different year.
- **Bonus Analysis**: Identifies stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
